  <rdfs:comment>A movement is a self-contained part of a musical work. While individual or selected movements from a composition are sometimes performed separately, a performance of the complete work requires all the movements to be performed in succession.

Often a composer attempts to interrelate the movements thematically, or sometimes in more subtle ways, in order that the individual
movements exert a cumulative effect. In some forms, composers sometimes link the movements, or ask for them to be played without a
pause between them.

  <rdfs:comment>The intellectual or artistic realization of a work in the form of alpha-numeric, musical, or choreographic notation, sound, etc., or any combination of such forms.    


For example:

Work #1 Franz Schubert's Trout quintet

    * Expression #1 the composer's score
    * Expression #2 sound issued from the performance by the Amadeus Quartet and Hephzibah Menuhin on piano
    * Expression #3 sound issued from the performance by the Cleveland Quartet and Yo-Yo Ma on the cello
    * . . . . 

The Music Ontology defines the following sub-concepts of a MusicalExpression, which should be used instead of MusicalExpression itself: Score (the
result of an arrangement), Sound (produced during a performance), Signal. However, it is possible to stick to FRBR and bypass the worflow
mechanism this ontology defines by using the core FRBR properties on such objects. But it is often better to use events to interconnect such 
expressions (allowing to go deeply into the production process - `this performer was playing this particular instrument at that
particular time').

    ns1:term_status="unstable">
  <rdfs:comment>A single exemplar of a musical expression.
    
For example, it could be a single exemplar of a CD. This is normally an single object (a CD) possessed by somebody.

From the FRBR final report: The entity defined as item is a concrete entity. It is in many instances a single physical object (e.g., a copy of a one-volume monograph, a single audio cassette, etc.). There are instances, however, where the entity defined as item comprises more than one physical object (e.g., a monograph issued as two separately bound volumes, a recording issued on three separate compact discs, etc.).

In terms of intellectual content and physical form, an item exemplifying a manifestation is normally the same as the manifestation itself. However, variations may occur from one item to another, even when the items exemplify the same manifestation, where those variations are the result of actions external to the intent of the producer of the manifestation (e.g., damage occurring after the item was produced, binding performed by a library, etc.).

This entity is related to the edition/production/publication of a musical expression (musical manifestation are closely related with the music industry (their terms, concepts, definitions, methods (production, publication, etc.), etc.)
    
From the FRBR final report: The entity defined as manifestation encompasses a wide range of materials, including manuscripts, books, periodicals, maps, posters, sound recordings, films, video recordings, CD-ROMs, multimedia kits, etc. As an entity, manifestation represents all the physical objects that bear the same characteristics, in respect to both intellectual content and physical form.


Work #1 J. S. Bach's Six suites for unaccompanied cello

    * Expression #1 sound issued during the performance by Janos Starker recorded in 1963 and 1965
          o Manifestation #1 recordings released on 33 1/3 rpm sound discs in 1965 by Mercury
          o Manifestation #2 recordings re-released on compact disc in 1991 by Mercury 
    * Expression #2 sound issued during the performances by Yo-Yo Ma recorded in 1983
          o Manifestation #1 recordings released on 33 1/3 rpm sound discs in 1983 by CBS Records
          o Manifestation #2 recordings re-released on compact disc in 1992 by CBS Records 

          
Changes that occur deliberately or even inadvertently in the production process that affect the copies result, strictly speaking, in a new manifestation. A manifestation resulting from such a change may be identified as a particular "state" or "issue" of the publication.

Changes that occur to an individual copy after the production process is complete (e.g., the loss of a page, rebinding, etc.) are not considered to result in a new manifestation. That copy is simply considered to be an exemplar (or item) of the manifestation that deviates from the copy as produced.

With the entity defined as manifestation we can describe the physical characteristics of a set of items and the characteristics associated with the production and distribution of that set of items that may be important factors in enabling users to choose a manifestation appropriate to their physical needs and constraints, and to identify and acquire a copy of that manifestation.

Defining manifestation as an entity also enables us to draw relationships between specific manifestations of a work. We can use the relationships between manifestations to identify, for example, the specific publication that was used to create a microreproduction.

  <rdfs:comment>    Distinct intellectual or artistic musical creation.
    
From the FRBR final report: A work is an abstract entity; there is no single material object one can point to as the work. We recognize the work through individual realizations or expressions of the work, but the work itself exists only in the commonality of
content between and among the various expressions of the work. When we speak of Homer's Iliad as a work, our point of reference is not a particular recitation or text of the work, but the intellectual creation that lies behind all the various expressions of the work.     

For example:

work #1 J. S. Bach's The art of the fugue

  <rdfs:comment>Used to relate a work or the expression of a work to an artist who djmixed it. 
    
The artist usually selected the tracks, chose their sequence, and slightly changed them by fading (so that one track blends in smoothly with the other) or pitching (so that the tempo of one track matches the tempo of the following track). This applies to a 'Mixtape' in which all tracks were DJ-mixed together into one single long track. </rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment>                This property can be used to link from a person to the website where they make their works available, or from

        It is better to use one of the three sub-properties instead of this one in order to specify wether the
        content can be accessed for free (mo:freedownload), if it is just free preview material (mo:previewdownload), or
        if it can be accessed for some money (mo:paiddownload) (this includes links to the Amazon store, for example).

                This property MUST be used only if the content is just available through a web page (holding, for example
                a Flash application) - it is better to link to actual content directly through the use of mo:available_as and
                mo:Stream, mo:Torrent or mo:ED2K, etc. Therefore, Semantic Web user agents that don't know how to read HTML and even
                less to rip streams from Flash applications can still access the audio content.

  <rdfs:comment>The European Article Number (EAN) is a universal identifier for products, commonly printed in form of barcodes on them. The numbers represented by those codes can either be 8 or 13 digits long, with the 13-digit-version being most common. EANs form a superset of the North American Universal Product Code (UPC) as every UPC can be made an EAN by adding a leading zero to it. Additionally every EAN is also a Japanese Article Number (JAN). The identifiers were formerly assigned by EAN International which merged with Uniform Code Council (UCC, the guys behind the UPCs) and Electronic Commerce Council of Canada (ECCC) to become GS1. </rdfs:comment>

                This property MUST be used only if the content is just available through a web page (holding, for example
                a Flash application) - it is better to link to actual content directly through the use of mo:available_as and
                mo:Stream, mo:Torrent or mo:ED2K, etc. Therefore, Semantic Web user agents that don't know how to read HTML and even
                less to rip streams from Flash applications can still access the audio content.
