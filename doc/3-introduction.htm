<p>

Internet changed the music industry.  At first, sharing systems like <a href="http://www.napster.com">Napster</a> 
allowed people to share any song they had on their computer with millions other people. 
That new reality changed the music industry’s landscape for good, and many juridical battles followed. 
However, a biggest change followed a couple of years later. 
Communities like <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> started to appear. 
Strong of millions of regular users, such communities helped garage bands and obscure musicians to create 
their musical niche: the longtail of the music industry. 
This second change is more profound than the first one: 
now any musician has the possibility to reach their audience by sharing their work on the Web. 
In the mean time, a free database called <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> archiving 
million of between artists, albums and tracks appeared; music suggesting services like 
<a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> or <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.FM</a> started to appear and Apple started 
to sell individual tracks at 1$ with <a href="http://www.itunes.com">iTunes</a>.</p>

<p>At that point, the music industry of the eighties leaded by blockbusters was completely changed.</p>

The Music Ontology is an attempt to  provide a vocabulary for linking a wide range music-related information, 
and to provide a democratic mechanism for doing so. 
Anybody can publish Music Ontology data and link it with existing data, in order to help 
create a music-related <i>web of data</i>.

For example, John Doe may publish some information about a performance he saw last night (like the fact
that he was there, and a review). Mary Doe may publish the fact that she attended the same performance, that
she recorded it using her cell-phone, and that the corresponding item is available in her podcast.
 
The Music Ontology provides a vocabulary to express information ranging from this example to:
</p>
<pre>
In this performance was interpreted a particular arrangement of the Trout Quintet by Franz Schubert.
</pre>
<pre>
This work was performed ten times, but only two of these performances were recorded.
</pre>
<pre>
Ten takes of this particular track have been recorded, each of which with a particular microphone location.
</pre>
<pre>
"Come as You Are" by Nirvana was released on a single and the "Nevermind" album.
</pre>
<pre>
During this gig, the band played ten songs. During the last one (a cover of "Eight days a week"), 
the drummer from the support band joined them to play with them.
</pre>

<p>
The Music Ontology is divided in three levels of expressiveness - from the simplest one to the more complex one.
Everything is clustered around the following categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Level 1:</strong> aims at providing a vocabulary for simple editorial information (tracks/artists/releases, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Level 2:</strong> aims at providing a vocabulary for expressing the <i>music creation workflow</i> (composition, arrangement,
performance, recording, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Level 3:</strong> aims at providing a vocabulary for complex event decomposition, to express, for example, what happened during
a particular performance, what is the melody line of a particular work, etc.</li>
</ul>
